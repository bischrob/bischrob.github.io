Today I converted my website to the Quarto format instead of the Jekyll Github Pages format. You can learn more about Quarto blogs [here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html). I did this mostly because it will be easier to manage and update. 

Let me know if you find any errors in a post after the conversion. I can be reached at [bischrob@gmail.com](mailto:bischrob@gmail.com).
